=== Geoip filter plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

The GeoIP filter adds information about the geographical location of IP addresses,
based on data from the MaxMind GeoLite2 databases.

==== Supported Databases

This plugin is bundled with https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2[GeoLite2] City database out of the box. From MaxMind's description --
"GeoLite2 databases are free IP geolocation databases comparable to, but less accurate than, MaxMindâ€™s
GeoIP2 databases". Please see GeoIP Lite2 license for more details.

https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases[Commercial databases] from MaxMind are also supported in this plugin.

If you need to use databases other than the bundled GeoLite2 City, you can download them directly
from MaxMind's website and use the `database` option to specify their location. The GeoLite2 databases
can be https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2[downloaded from here].

If you would like to get Autonomous System Number(ASN) information, you can use the GeoLite2-ASN database.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-database_license"]
==== Database License

https://www.maxmind.com[MaxMind] changed from releasing the GeoIP database under
a Creative Commons (CC) license to a proprietary end-user license agreement
(EULA).  The MaxMind EULA requires Logstash to update the MaxMind database
within 30 days of a database update. If Logstash fails to download the database
for 30 days, it will stop the pipeline in order to maintain compliance.

The GeoIP filter plugin can manage the database for users running the Logstash default
distribution, or you can manage
database updates on your own. The behavior is controlled by the `database` setting.
When you use the default `database` setting, the auto-update feature ensures that the plugin is
using the latest version of the database.
Otherwise, you are responsible for maintaining compliance.

The Logstash open source distribution uses the MaxMind Creative Commons license
database by default.

==== Details

A `[geoip][location]` field is created if
the GeoIP lookup returns a latitude and longitude. The field is stored in
http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html[GeoJSON] format. Additionally,
the default Elasticsearch template provided with the
{logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html[elasticsearch output] maps
the `[geoip][location]` field to an {ref}/geo-point.html[Elasticsearch Geo_point datatype].

As this field is a `geo_point` _and_ it is still valid GeoJSON, you get
the awesomeness of Elasticsearch's geospatial query, facet and filter functions
and the flexibility of having GeoJSON for all other applications (like Kibana's
map visualization).

[NOTE]

This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from
http://www.maxmind.com. This database is licensed under
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License].

Versions 4.0.0 and later of the GeoIP filter use the MaxMind GeoLite2 database
and support both IPv4 and IPv6 lookups. Versions prior to 4.0.0 use the legacy
MaxMind GeoLite database and support IPv4 lookups only.

|=======================================================================

Also see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for a list of options supported by all
filter plugins.

&nbsp;

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-cache_size"]
===== `cache_size`

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1000`

GeoIP lookup is surprisingly expensive. This filter uses an cache to take advantage of the fact that
IPs agents are often found adjacent to one another in log files and rarely have a random distribution.
The higher you set this the more likely an item is to be in the cache and the faster this filter will run.
However, if you set this too high you can use more memory than desired.
Since the Geoip API upgraded to v2, there is not any eviction policy so far, if cache is full, no more record can be added.
Experiment with different values for this option to find the best performance for your dataset.

This MUST be set to a value > 0. There is really no reason to not want this behavior, the overhead is minimal
and the speed gains are large.

It is important to note that this config value is global to the geoip_type. That is to say all instances of the geoip filter
of the same geoip_type share the same cache. The last declared cache size will 'win'. The reason for this is that there would be no benefit
to having multiple caches for different instances at different points in the pipeline, that would just increase the
number of cache misses and waste memory.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-database"]
===== `database`

  * Value type is <<path,path>>
  * If not specified, the database defaults to the GeoLite2 City database that ships with Logstash.

The path to MaxMind's database file that Logstash should use. The default database is GeoLite2-City.
GeoLite2-City, GeoLite2-Country, GeoLite2-ASN are the free databases from MaxMind that are supported.
GeoIP2-City, GeoIP2-ISP, GeoIP2-Country are the commercial databases from MaxMind that are supported.

Database auto-update applies to default distribution. When `database` points to user's database path,
auto-update will be disabled.
See
<<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-database_license,Database License>> for more information.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-default_database_type"]
===== `default_database_type`

This plugin now includes both the GeoLite2-City and GeoLite2-ASN databases.  If `database` and `default_database_type` are unset, the GeoLite2-City database will be selected.  To use the included GeoLite2-ASN database, set `default_database_type` to `ASN`.

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * The default value is `City`
  * The only acceptable values are `City` and `ASN`

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-fields"]
===== `fields`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

An array of geoip fields to be included in the event.

Possible fields depend on the database type. By default, all geoip fields
are included in the event.

For the built-in GeoLite2 City database, the following are available:
`city_name`, `continent_code`, `country_code2`, `country_code3`, `country_name`,
`dma_code`, `ip`, `latitude`, `location`, `longitude`, `postal_code`, `region_code`,
`region_name`, `location` and `timezone`.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility"]
===== `ecs_compatibility`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Supported values are:
** `disabled`: unstructured geo data added at root level
** `v1`: uses fields that are compatible with Elastic Common Schema (for example, `[client][geo][country_name]`)
* Default value depends on which version of Logstash is running:
** When Logstash provides a `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` setting, its value is used as the default
** Otherwise, the default value is `disabled`.

Controls this plugin's compatibility with the {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)].
The value of this setting affects the _default_ value of <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-target>>.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-source"]
===== `source`

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The field containing the IP address or hostname to map via geoip. If
this field is an array, only the first value will be used.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-tag_on_failure"]
===== `tag_on_failure`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `["_geoip_lookup_failure"]`

Tags the event on failure to look up geo information. This can be used in later analysis.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-target"]
===== `target`

  * This is an optional setting with condition.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value depends on whether <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility>> is enabled:
  ** ECS Compatibility disabled: `geoip`
  ** ECS Compatibility enabled: If `source` is an `ip` sub-field, eg. `[client][ip]`,
      `target` will automatically set to the parent field, in this example `client`,
      otherwise, `target` is a required setting
  *** `geo` field is nested in `[client][geo]`
  *** ECS compatible values are `client`, `destination`, `host`, `observer`, `server`, `source`

Specify the field into which Logstash should store the geoip data.
This can be useful, for example, if you have `src_ip` and `dst_ip` fields and
would like the GeoIP information of both IPs.

If you save the data to a target field other than `geoip` and want to use the
`geo_point` related functions in Elasticsearch, you need to alter the template
provided with the Elasticsearch output and configure the output to use the
new template.

Even if you don't use the `geo_point` mapping, the `[target][location]` field
is still valid GeoJSON.
